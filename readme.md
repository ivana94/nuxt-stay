# Nuxt Stay

This Airbnb clone allows users to find short-term rentals as well as post your own property for rent. Users can find properties, request them for certain dates, and process payments. Hosts are able to upload photos of their properties, descriptions, and availability dates.

On the homepage you can type in an address and the site will return any results near the address you searched. Once you select on a property, you can add the dates you would like to book, enter your credit card information, and pay.
