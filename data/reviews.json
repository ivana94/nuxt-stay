A few minor notes—the neighbor is an early riser and started mowing the lawn right next to our bedroom windows at 7:30am. I also thought it was weird that we had to empty the dishwasher and take out all of the garbage before we checked out at 10am. I normally load and run the dishwasher before I leave but was unable to do so since the dishwasher had to be emptied and everything in it’s originally place. It’s minor but since the cleaning fee is more then I paid my maid for deep cleaning I would have thought I could load the dishwasher and run it and wouldn’t have to take the garbage out. Otherwise cute house, good neighborhood, clean, and comfy."
